All use cases introduced in this chapter aim at giving **an idea of what the Arianee Protocol can look like in production**. Sometimes, a demo is better than a long explanation! 

This demo is **backed by the [ArianeeJS library](arianee-js) developed to use the Arianee Protocol.** 

For obvious reasons, the code below executes on a test environment. 

## Preliminary step
We recommend using the **.Wallet application by Arianee** to enjoy this demo from the end users' perspective. To download the application you can follow the links below:

## Create and claim an Arianee certificate
This demo initializes the test environment and **creates a basic certificate** based on this <a href="https://cert.arianee.org/cert/sampleCert.json" target="_blank">JSON file</a>. A QR code with the URL of the transfer request is generated by the certificate issuer so that you can see and **claim the certificate on the .Wallet application by Arianee**.

Please note the certificate issuer is unknown (the issuing wallet is a random one), so the authenticity of the certificate issuer cannot be verified. To learn more on authentic certificates, please refer to the [authenticity criteria](arianee-decentralized#about-certificate-authenticity).

## Transfer a certificate and check certificate history

This demo initializes the test environment and creates a basic certificate based on this <a href="https://cert.arianee.org/cert/sampleCert.json" target="_blank">JSON file</a>. A QR code with the URL of the transfer request is generated so that you can see and claim the certificate on the .Wallet application by Arianee.

The major difference with the previous use case is that the transfer request is not initiated by by the certificate issuer, the **transfer request is initiated by a random wallet who received the certificate from the certificate issuer**. This use case could happen when the first owner of a certificate resell hi product for example.

The difference between this use case and the previous one can be seen by comparing the **certificate history of these certificates** (accessible within the certificate on the .Wallet application by Arianee)

Please note the certificate issuer is unknown (the issuing wallet is a random one), so the authenticity of the issuer cannot be verified. To learn more on authentic certificates, please refer to the [authenticity criteria](arianee-decentralized#about-certificate-authenticity).

## Check the proof of authenticity of a certificate

This demo initializes the test environment and creates a basic certificate based on this <a href="https://cert.arianee.org/cert/sampleCert.json" target="_blank">JSON file</a> with a custom title you can choose. A QR code with the URL of the transfer request is generated so that you can see and claim the certificate on the .Wallet application by Arianee.

The major difference with the previous use cases is that the certificate issuer is a verified Brand (on the Test environment !) so that the certificate fills in all the [authenticity criteria](arianee-decentralized#about-certificate-authenticity). You can see the **proof of authenticity** of the certificate on the .Wallet application by Arianee by clicking on the logo ![alt_text](../img/arianee_cocarde.png "image_tooltip")

Also, in this use-case the wallet of the certificate issuer already exists and is loaded with certificate credits. That means **faster execution** !
