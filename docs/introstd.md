According to the European Committe for Standardization a standard is a technical document designed to be used as a rule, guideline or definition. It is a consensus-built, repeatable way of doing something. 

With one more thing in mind, interoperability across software solutions, the Arianee project chose to share its standards using JSON schema to support multi-language and to be extensible. These JSON schema describe the structure and content expected when using the Arianee Protocol. 

The Arianee project standards relate to the Arianee protocol features and are built / updated by bringing together all interested parties.

### Supported JSON schema

[Arianee Identity i18n](ArianeeIdentity-i18n) describes the identity of a company (Brand or third party)

[Arianee Asset i18n](ArianeeAsset-i18n) describes the identity of a certificate for a digital or real-life product (watch, sneaker, etc.)

[Arianee Event i18n](ArianeeEvent-i18n) describes the identity of an event (service, auction, etc.)

Arianee Message i18n describes the identity of a message (coming soon)
