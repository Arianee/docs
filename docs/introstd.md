In order to have interoperable content between software, we need to define standards to structure information.

These JSON Schemas describe JSON contents to use inside Arianee Protocol.

These schema are designed to support multi languages and to be extensible.

### Current supported schema

[Arianee Identity i18n](ArianeeIdentity-i18n) describes an identity of a company 

[Arianee Asset i18n](ArianeeAsset-i18n) describes a certificate, like a watch, a sneaker, ...

[Arianee Event i18n](ArianeeEvent-i18n) describes an event such as a service, auction ...

Arianee Message describe a message (coming soon)


### _deprecated json schema_

If you want to support older schema, you need to support :
[Arianee Asset](ArianeeAsset)
