To use the Arianee protocol properly the following is required:

- **Interfaces** to interact with the Arianee protocol,
- **Some ARIA** (the digital currency of the Arianee protocol) to pay for premium features if you are a Brand or a third party.
- A **verified identity & staking** to issue authentic features if you are a Brand or a third party.

## **Build interfaces**

To build interfaces and expose the Arianee protocol in all its beauty, multiple options are introduced in the [How to Proceed](howToProceed) chapter.

## **Buying Aria**

The Aria token is scheduled to be available on public exchanges from January 2020. Until that date, Aria tokens can be bought by contacting the Arianee project team (hello@arianee.org).

To learn more about the Aria token, please refer to the [Arianee Economy](AriaEconomy) chapter.

## **Verifying a Brand identity**

To learn more please refer to the [Know your business (KYB) process](KYBprocess) chapter.
