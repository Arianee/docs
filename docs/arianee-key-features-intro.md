The Arianee protocol enables management of custom assets called Certificates. A certificate represents a unique, either digital or real-life product with its unique metadata stored as a data imprint on a distributed ledger. The Arianee protocol enables an effective and multi-function library for managing certificates. Its core features include:

- [**Creation of certificate**](../docs/arianee-creation). This feature is dedicated to Brands.
- [**Transfer of certifcate**](../docs/arianee-transfer) from one owner to another. Except for very specific cases, the transfer can only be initiated by the current owner.
- [**Proof of ownership.**](../docs/arianee-proof-of-ownership) It can only be generated by the owner of a certificate.
- [**Message.**](../docs/arianee-message) Brands and third parties who interacted with a certificate can interact with it through messages.
- [**Event.**](../docs/arianee-event) Brands and third parties can enrich a certificate through events.
- [**Certificates history.**](../docs/arianee-certificate-history) All dates and types of events related to a certificate are recorded and available on the Blockchain.
- [**Update certificate.**](../docs/arianee-certificate-update) The issuer of a Certificate can provide and record a new version of the content associated with a Certificate already existing on the Blockchain.
