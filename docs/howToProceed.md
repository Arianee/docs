To build interfaces and expose the Arianee protocol in all its beauty, multiple options are introduced here below to answer the needs and the technical level of each stakeholder.

## Ready to use tools with the Arianee Suite (easy)

The Arianee project embraces a world where developers, startups, integrators or even Brands build their own applications, integrations or connectors to leverage the Arianee protocol.

Such world does not exist (yet!), so Arianee SAS developed a suite of applications to support pilot projects and the adoption of the Arianee protocol:

- The **Brand Data Hub** is a web application for Brands to create and manage certificates (Certificate Management Platform). Each Brand Data Hub is dedicated to one Brand only.

- The **.Wallet application by Arianee** is a mobile application available on the App Store and Google Play for owners to claim and manage their certificates. The application let the owner import or use a newly created POA Network address to manage his/her certificates.

To learn more about the Arianee suite, please contact us (hello@arianee.org).


## **API integration with ArianeeJS library (medium)**

The Arianee project designed the ArianeeJS library to interact directly with the Arianee protocol at the API level. The ArianeeJS library can be used to build :

- Custom tools for the Arianee protocol ecosystem 
- Integrations with tools used by companies such as ERP or CRM 

To learn more about the ArianeeJS library, we recommend you to start with [the live demo](livedemo) and then dig deeper into [the ArianeeJS Documentation](ArianeeJS).


## **Blockchain integration with smart contracts (advanced)**

Blockchain developers can interact with the Arianee protocol directly at the level of smart contracts.

To learn more about the smart contracts, please refer to the [testnet smart contracts](testnet) and [mainnet smart contracts](mainnet).

## Custom integration

Some companies have specific needs when it comes to connect the Arianee protocol to their current tools such as ERP or CRM.
