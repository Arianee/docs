In the Blockchain world, staking is the act of locking up one's coins or tokens.

## **What is it for ?**

The Arianee project requests Brands and third parties to stake in order to complete their [Know Your Business (KYB)](KYBprocess) process.

**Staking is a demonstration of good faith and a testimony of a Brand or third partyâ€™s commitment and engagement in the Arianee protocol.**

## **Staking process**

First, the staking entity needs some Aria because stakes are accounted for in Aria (the currency of the Arianee protocol). To learn more about the ARIA token and how to buy some, please refer to the [Arianee Economy](arianee-economy) chapter.

Second, staking Aria consists of sending them to the *Arianee staking* smart contract. To learn more about smart contracts, please refer to the [Arianee Decentralized Platform](arianee-decentralized) chapter.

Multiple options are available for this second step, depending on the technical level of the staking entity:

- Outsourcing it to a third party which can be recommended by the Arianee project ([hello@arianee.org](mailto:hello@arianee.org)).
- In-house by developers with the ArianeeJS library or at the smart contract level.
- Using a compatible software such as the Brand data hub.

## **Staking amounts**

The stakes the Arianee project requests from Brands and third parties to complete their [Know Your Business (KYB)](kyb-process) process are defined in fiat currency (USD) payable only in Aria. The price in Aria is adjusted every day by Oracles based on the previous daily average Aria/USD exchange rate.

The amount requested depends on the number of employees of the staking entity:

- 500 USD : less than 10 employees.
- 2 500 USD : 10 to 49 employees.
- 10 000 USD : 50 to 499 employees.
- 25 000 USD : 500 to 4 999 employees.
- 50 000 USD : more than 5 000 employees.

## **Staking rules**

## **Staking return & fees**

**Fees may apply if the staking entity outsources** to a third party or uses an external software to stake. 

There is no fee (such as entrance, management, performance or exit fees) implemented on the *Arianee staking* smart contract.

There is no return on Aria staked (such as dividend) implemented on the *Arianee staking* smart contract. However, the value in fiat currency (USD) of Aria staked by a staking entity changes with the evolution of the ARIA/USD exchange rate, just like Aria on any other wallet.
